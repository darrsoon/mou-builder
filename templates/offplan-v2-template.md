# Off-Plan MOU Template v2 — размеченная версия

Это эталонный текст нового off-plan шаблона с условными маркерами и плейсхолдерами.

и собирает финальный договор.

## Примечания

1. **Исправлен баг исходника**: в блоке SELLER'S AGENCY стояло `Date: {{buyer_signature_date}}` → заменено на `{{seller_signature_date}}`.
2. `{{seller_signature_block}}` / `{{buyer_signature_block}}` — код генерирует по строке Name/Signature/Date на каждого участника стороны (как в сделке Lilac с двумя продавцами).
3. Держатель чека в статье 6 — вычисляемый плейсхолдер `{{..._deposit_holder}}`. При обоих агентах повторяет исходный шаблон (Buyer без реквизитов → Seller's Agency; Buyer с реквизитами → Buyer's Agency; Seller → Seller's Agency). При одном агенте — оба чека у него. Без агентов — чек держит противоположная сторона, и ст. 9 автоматически меняет «the Agent» на «the Parties» (та же логика, что в старом коде, коммит 7916267).
4. Фраза undertaking letter (третье лицо) реализована только для Buyer — как в исходном шаблоне. Если понадобится для Seller, добавляется тем же маркером.
5. Жирный шрифт — родное форматирование Google Doc, маркеры `<< >>` для текста шаблона больше не нужны (остаются только для party blocks, генерируемых кодом).
